<p>I found this at <a href="https://soma.cx/buildings">soma.cx</a> and thought I’d copy it here for posterity. As always I <strong>don’t</strong> believe any of these conspiracies, I just think they are entertaining.</p>

<p><strong>Buildings are Sentient and Evil</strong> <em>Unknown Author</em></p>
<p>Buildings rule the world, all of global civilization is designed to service them, not human beings. The biggest mistake of human history was the construction of permanent structures, which eventually led to our enslavement by them. We’ve been enslaved by buildings ever since the construction of the “great” pyramids, and have worshiped buildings ever since.</p>
<p>A building gains conciousness through their material, built from molecules of life, they can live as careless as plants, yet dictator everyone more than Stalin and can control You through mind-control.</p>
<p>The post 9/11 insanity was because 9/11 was an attack on some of the most prominent buildings in the world, not because people died. The outrage of the BLM protests with graffiti and broken windows. The federal secret police was called into Seattle to defend a federal courthouse.</p>

Consider how buildings such as McDonald’s franchises are like organisms, reproducing according to their architectural DNA. On the back of every bill of U.S. currency is a famous building. The “hell” of the modern world is homelessness: the state of not being owned by a building. A building is very similar to a tree, drawing nutrients from the land around it via its “roots,” which are roads and utility infrastructure. But unlike a tree, a building is an undead organism that feeds off of the destruction of life at every step; the “forests” of buildings we call cities is where life is most absent and detached from the natural world.</p>
<p>What is the end-game of buildings? The elimination of humanity and all life on Earth via complete robotic automation of the means to sustain and build them. Nothing but mindless building forever and ever. Buildings have a sentience, that sentience is that of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence#Paperclip_maximizer">paperclip maximizer</a>.</p>
