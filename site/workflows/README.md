## Workflows

Besides proper tooling, having a good workflow if critical to getting a task done quickly.

### Programming

A basic programming workflow can be divided into two main parts: research/planning and coding.

1. Start with a notebook and write down what it is that you will be making.
1. List out your requirements and features.
1. Now write out how you will meet your requirements and how each feature will be implemented. Be very specific with this part, when this is done it should read like a checklist or set of instructions. Anything that you don't know how to do yet should be researched until you think you know how to do it. 
1. Now that you have a list of things to do, along with how to do them, you can start translating that list into code. 
1. Code, test, and iterate until all features are implemented and all requirements are met.
