## Preface
While looking for a another mushroom related conspiracy I ran accross this one.
Remember I **don't** believe these conspiracy theories, I just find them entertaining.

## Conspiracy Starts Here
The biggest conspiracy of all is the mushroom conspiracy.

Here's why:

1. Stoned ape theory. Why is this not more popular? I think it makes a lot of sense acutally.
1. You can only buy one type of mushroom (at most stores) and they even call it different names (portobello, button, baby bella, crimini) these are all the same mushroom. To me it looks like they are trying to deceive us by making it look like we have variety when we don't.
1. Mushrooms really are medicine. They are full of nutrients and everyone is scared of them.
1. The best medicine we have is antibiotics and it comes from fungus. Why wouldn't other fungus fight other bacterias and viruses? Well they do. People arn't educated about them and fear them.
1. Mycologists believe the entire earths crust is covered in mycelium. Sometimes I wonder if they are responsible for the evolution of all things; if they make planets living if you will. We should send them to Mars and Venus and the moon.
1. Even the rain needs mushrooms. The clouds can't hold water without enough debris and the majority of that debris is spores.
1. Every breath you take has spores. These things are very significant...
1. In ancient China and ancient Egypt mushrooms were only for royalty, commoners were punished for having them.
1. On the Joe Rogan show with Paul Stamets, Paul had to stop the conversation when Joe was prying for info on portobello mushrooms, and he said, "I can't talk about this because I could get killed."
1. The oldest mushroom fossil dates back 800 million to a billion years old...these things are incrdibly evolved and don't even need to have sex. You can break them apart and more will grow and faster. This is even a cultivation method. To put you in perspective, we only date back around 300,000 years.
1. I have been making my own extracts for a while now and I have been blowing my own mind with how much better my life has gotten since I started eating theses and foraging and using them on my face and everything. Chanterelles, puffballs, boletes, honey mushrooms.
1. A lot of people believe you can travel to different planets and areas in space when you eat psychedelic mushrooms.
1. There are fungi in the rainforest that target specific animals when they get too overpopulated and balance out the nature so to say.
1. Maria Sabina is a Mexican shaman who gave mushrooms to celebrities and royalty once westerners discovered them for enlightenment. The Beatles and Rockefeller even got mushrooms from her.
1. I fasted on foraged mushrooms for 2 months and pooped out dead pin worms. This happened 4 years ago. This makes me think about the scene in the matrix where Neo gets bugged. Metaphorically the red pill works synonymously.
1. There are mushroom cave paintings around the world depicting bulls and mushrooms on the ground. Could this imply that they ate mushrooms and became artistic and were explaining that?
1. There are pictures of Jesus with mushrooms in stained glass windows at very popular historic churches around the world.
1. Lion's mane mushroom and reishi mushroom are sold as nootropic supplements. The 5000 year old mummified corpse Otzi was found in the alps in the 90s with Piptoporus betulinus attached to his belt. It may have been used a medicine.
1. LSD is also a fungus-derived drug made with ergotamine. Ergotamine comes from Claviceps fungus.
1. Ergotamine is also used in migraine medicine called cafergot. It was obsoleted in the 90s with the introduction of sumatriptan but still works for many people.
1. If you look up why psilocybin exists, the popular consensus is that it's a poison to keep bugs and animals away. What I've seen is that they love that shit. I have seen famils of centipedes come out from inside them. I have seen plenty of fire ant colonies, build their ant hill over a turd a day after I picked giant mushrooms out of it. Squirrels eat them. Snails love them. Everyone knows that nat flys love them.
1. The fact that they call the brain the "default mode network" when you become an adult is so little of your brain is lit up under an mri. But if you look at an adult on mushrooms or a child under an mri the whole brain lights up. The creepy part is how they try to normalize it with the wording "default mode network".
1. Cordycept mushrooms take over the minds of insects and are parasitic to the insect. Paul Stamets developed a way to rid termites forever and it is not used because it soves the problem completely. I sometimes wonder if psychedelic mushrooms are symbiotic relationship when we eat them.
1. It is illegal to possess psychedelic mushrooms but not deathcaps or destroying angels. What is the real agenda here iis it really safety?
1. I'm saying that big pharma is part of the mushroom conspiracy because they are the answer to big pharma. One time I ask my doctor about mushrooms as medicine and he said, "have I heard of it? I'm a victim of it!" I thought that was very strange I still have no explanation.

If life is a test I don't think it's a test how well we can listen to people. Maybe there is something special with them. Maybe we can listen and learn from them.

Does anyone agree with this? Let me know your thoughts. Please help share this post. (Govern-ment - to cntrl the min](conspire-I-c)
